        This Portfolio is based around the Space Resources Value Chain.
        <br></br> 
        <br></br> 
        Value chains are used by business and industries to explain what they do. Here are ways to write the value chains for the terrestrial mining industry and the terrestrial manufacturing industry.  
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        The Space Resources Value Chain begins with Explore(EX), followed by Establish Feasibility(EF), Mine(MN), Process(PC), Manufacture(MF), Distribution(DS), Sell(SL).
